Using Guava
===========
 
This is the backing code for the 'Making Java Bearable with Guava' presentation.  All code is used in the presentation uses a TestNG test.  Find the test you wish to run and run it in your IDE.

If you want to run add tests in a command prompt type:

    mvn test

If you want to run a specific test in the command prompt type:

    mvn test -Dtest=IntsTest

Replace `IntsTest` with whatever test class you wish to run.
